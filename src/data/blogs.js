        title: "Overtime Work: A Paradox",
        detailsOne: "Overtime or Longer Working has long been a common issue in workplaces across the globe, where employees are rewarded and measured on how much time they spend in their workplace, regardless of whether they are less productive as the day goes on. Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development conducted a survey last year in UK that revealed longer work has more than tripled since 2010. It was a minor survey, with 1,000 participants, but there is further more deep research has been done to support the result. Some research says that according to the Office of National Statistics UK, people now work 30 minutes more every week compared to 10 years ago, in country like Bangladesh this situation is eviler. What’s more, a report by Vitality showed that staying late or working additional hours is having a reverse effect; in reality, overtime is causing a loss of 27 days of productive time per employee every year.",

        detailsTwo: "More production yields more revenues. Therefore, there is always pressure for people to work harder, longer hours. This is demonstrably a Bad Idea.",
        detailsThree: "Overtime is a common practice where the employers believe that worker should stay long to get more done, working more, produces more but with the “Law of Diminishing Return”.  Looking at the number of units we ignore the impact on Productivity. The more time the workers work the more number units may be gaining to total production but flashing light on the other side of the coin, the productivity goes down over the time in overtime. Taking the example of garments industry, two hours OT is a common operation in many factories. Please give a closer look at the number of production in the regular time and the number of production in the overtime, Statistics revels that in most cases the number of production with the same input of Man, Machine, Material in regular working hours is much higher and in better quality than working overtime which has an adverse impact on the profitability of factory.",

        detailsFour: "The above paragraph, I have mentioned about the Law of Diminishing Return which tells that the more the input in the process may increase the number of production but may not be at the proportion of input given. Any further input after optimum level the proportion of output outputs goes down due to the natural Law of Diminishing Return. In the same way human body has been programmed and designed to work at optimum level for 8 Hour, any further input of man hour decreases the level the productivity. If we look at the natural dimension of time where 24 hours has been fixed for us. Among the 24 hours of time 8 hours are for resting and sleeping and 8 hours for earning the bread and butter and rest 8 hours of our family, relatives, friend and for own self for self-development. Any ups and downs in the 8 hours slots in any slot will have an adverse impact which will make you less effective and lesser efficient which has a direct relation with personal productivity and progress and above all heath. If you’re always staying late at work, there are many issues that can arise, including feeling overworked, stressed and constantly tired. However, this can also develop into long-term mental health problems, such as burnout – which was recently recognized as an illness by the World Health Organization (WHO). Burn-out is a syndrome conceptualized as resulting from chronic workplace stress that has not been successfully managed,’ according to WHO. Constantly working could also affect your personal relationships and hinder your creativity. If you are regularly working beyond your contracted hours, this is likely to have a negative impact on other aspects of your life, particularly your mental and physical health, and relationships. ‘The brain needs time to switch off and recharge, we simply cannot be mentally active all the time. Creative thinking comes out of a quiet mind, and this means taking time away from work, ideally with our emails and social media switched off.",

        detailsFive: " There are some facts on impact of Overtime: People who work longer report sleeping less, which obviously has massive eﬀects on your health, Working 10 or more hours per day leads to a 60% increase in risk of cardiovascular problems. In another study, people who worked 55 hours per week showed poorer vocabulary and reasoning than those who worked 40 hours. Some studies indicate that knowledge workers are the most productive when they work 35 hours a week. Industrial accidents increase disproportionately as hours increase above forty per week, or above 8 hours per day. More than half of all industrial accidents occur in jobs with extended working hours. The generally-accepted hypothesis is that the accidents result from tiredness.",

        detailsSix: "Many European countries has adopted a policy to improve work-life balance for its citizens. The experiments of Lesser working time and flexible working time arrangements showing better productivity and happier personal life the country men and happier personal life has a proportionate relation with better productivity.   Employees of many European Countries are encourage to leave office after 5 PM to take care of their families and personal life. Working overtime is neither valued nor seen as necessary in fact it can be seen as an indication of poor planning and time management.",

        detailsSeven: "Here lies a big responsibility of HR. HR now has been considered as Strategic partner of the Business, the cost center concept is over now. Being the strategic business partner the job of HR is to add value to the organization through investing in the most appreciating capital of Business – Happy Human Capital. Satisfied and Happy Human Capital can bring more revenue and profitability than any other investment in the business. Take a closer look why employee needs to stay over time. If you discover the reason is possibly the culprit would be poor productivity and conventional management thinking of stay more to more to produce me. HR plays the vital role here to bring transformation in new thinking and culture aspect of “More with Less”.",

        detailsEight: "There is a saying- “Workaholic Will Die Before an Alcoholic”. Some Employees also wants show off to stay longer at office to show is supervisors that he/ she is better loyal to work. They create a smoke screen of showing busy than productivity and this camouflage their lower effectiveness. This pseudo Workaholics do not do any favors to their companies. They have high levels of stress, which undermine complex decision-making and cause crisis mentality, time urgency, blocked mentality, mistakes, and a portfolio of medical problems resulting in high absenteeism and medical expenses. They think no one can do the job as well as they can, so they can't delegate or trust, creates bottlenecks, conflicts, and missed deadlines. The conventional wisdom on productivity that settles of the endurance factor, or quantity of hours is dead wrong. For most alcoholics, it’s a long demise from cirrhosis of the liver or alcohol-related hepatitis. For workaholics, the end comes quickly in the prime of life, courtesy of stress-induced blood clots and heart attacks. It’s not a very productive outcome.",

        detailsNine: "Researchers have found that there is negative correlation between workaholic behavior—long hours, feeling you should be working every waking minute, overwork—and productivity. A research in University of Georgia found in a metastudy on workaholism research that “even though workaholics may spend more time thinking about and physically engaging in work than the average worker, this may not be of any benefit to their employer rather making the system inefficient.",

        detailsTen: "Time has come to think about the Concept of More with Less and continious elimination of ineffective and inefficient and non-valued adding activates from the system to be competitive edge. Traning, life coaching on Work Life Balance, Stress Management, Time management, Productivity, efficiency, Lean Thinking Psychology, etc. under erudite and sensible sensei can help breaking the mentality and hand holding guidance can help to avoid the Presenteeism or working overtime for a peaceful and healthy personal life and better profitable growth in working life."

        title: "Self- improvement: The Kaizen Way",
        detailsOne: "The fundamental principle of the Nature is to grow continuously which means Continuous improvement. If we even look at a tree, till its death its grows as a natural process, a river without flow is a dead river, the same way, a human without progressive mindset for Continuous growth is mentally dead. In the same manner company or a product without Continuous improvement as per the demand of time is at danger. The culture of Continuous improvement needs to be inbuilt in the system of the company to survive and growth.",

        detailsTwo: "Looking that the analysis, we see, in the last 15 years 52% of Fortune 500 companies has been vanished from the earth, one of the fundamental reasons would be not changing with the demand of time, means lack of Continuous improvement effort over time. On the opposite, the analysis says the great companies of today’s world has become Great due to the adoption of the philosophy of Continuous Improvement.  Continuous improvement in Japanese called- Kaizen, A Japanese productivity philosophy that translate to “Change for Good”.  ",
        detailsThree: "Looking at History of Japan’s Continuous growth and The Competitive Success, we see one of core element is Kaizen: The philosophy of Kaizen helps Japanese companies to outshine all other competitors by adhering to certain set policies and rules to eliminate defects and ensure long term superior quality, reducing lead time and cost and eventually customer satisfaction. Work for a Japanese company and you would soon realize how much focus and importance they to the process of Kaizen. Toyota, Japan's auto-industry leader, is well-known for implementing kaizen. In fact, kaizen is one of the core principles of Toyota, whose slogan is “Always a Better Way.”",

        detailsFour: "Kaizen” refers to a Japanese word which means “improvement” or “change for the better”. Kaizen is core to Lean Manufacturing, is a philosophy to creating continuous improvement based on the idea that small, ongoing positive changes can bring radical change over time by continuous effort by each and every employee from the CEO to line staff to ensure improvement of all processes and systems of a particular organization. It was developed in the manufacturing sector to lower defects, enhancing quality, eliminate waste, boost productivity, encourage worker purpose and accountability, and promote innovation. The ultimate goal of Kaizen is the transformation of culture of a company and Kaizen believes that the culture transforms when the mindset of the employee transforms which is essentially means the building the positive habits for progress for a start of journey from Good to Great! We often talk about Operational Excellence, but Operational Excellence without Personal Excellence is big vacuum. Elimination of defects and ensure long term superior quality, reducing lead time and cost and customer satisfaction is not only been required for an organization, it is eventually deeply needed by the an individual for its growth which ultimately leads the growth of the company. Until and unless the company men is growing the company will not grow, the Kaizen Mind Set. HR has a major role to play here.",

        detailsFive: "Kaizen has another profound meaning inside, the way Kaizen builds culture of Continuous improvement the same manner Kaizen helps individual in personal development, means building the habits of Continuous development more specifically reprogramming of the habits of the employees. It must be mentioned that changing of habits is not an easy task. It takes dedication and practice again and again and this is how the habits are reprogrammed.",

        detailsSix: "Although Kaizen is traditionally used in business it can be applied to self-improvement. In Today’s article let look at the influence of Kaizen on Personal Improvement. The Japanese method of Kaizen – meaning ‘change’ ‘good’ – is the practice of making small, step-by-step changes to transform your life in a big way. Improvement is infinite and Self- improvement is a never-ending lifelong journey.  It needs constant self-analysis, recognition, self-reflection and acknowledgement of bad habits, a desire for personal growth and most importantly, action in a positive direction.",

        detailsSeven: "With the new year well into motion, we focus on our New Year's resolutions or improving ourselves. Often, people make big promises to themselves at the beginning of the new year that are soon forgotten once the reality of everyday life sets in. Big goals can be overwhelming, wish for large, radical changes sound good but they can actually make you more resistant to change. There is a scientific and biological reason why this may happen, thanks to part of our brain called the “amygdala”",

        detailsEight: "The Amygdala is an almond-shaped set of neurons located in the brain. It is responsible for our fight-or-flight or stress response when we face with forthcoming danger. The Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Robert Mauer describe in the book, One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way: “When you want to change but experience a block, you can often blame the midbrain for gumming up the works. The midbrain is where you’ll find a structure called the amygdala. The amygdala is absolutely crucial to our survival. It controls the fight-or-flight response, an alarm mechanism that we share with all other mammals. It was designed to alert parts of the body for action in the face of immediate danger. One way it accomplishes this is to slow down or stop other functions such as rational and creative thinking that could interfere with the physical ability to run or fight.” He explains that the amygdala’s fight-or-flight response in today’s modern lifestyle, “…sets off alarm bells whenever we want to make a departure from our usual, safe routines.”",

        detailsNine: "Dr. Mauer explains that Kaizen is effective in preventing the amygdala from spoiling our efforts as, “The little steps of kaizen are a kind of stealth solution to this quality of the brain.” He says in the book. “As your small steps continue and your cortex starts working, the brain begins to create ‘software’ for your desired change actually laying down new nerve pathways and building new habits.” You may wish for a big change in your life but the amygdala prevents you bringing the change in you. It could bring on feelings of stress, panic and anxiety and cause us to stop and leave the cause of the discomfort, i.e. the new change. How to overcome this problem?",

        detailsTen: "The solution lies in Kaizen. Kaizen turns the giant goal in to baby steps aiming for little improvement each day gives your feel of victory and trigger release the small dose of Dopamine in your neuro system. Our brains don’t distinguish between small and large victories. Reaching a goal of any size triggers a release of dopamine, the “feel good” neurotransmitter. Dopamine motivates you to take action towards your goal gives you a surge of reinforcing pleasure when achieving them. Procrastination, self-doubt and low or lack of enthuse are linked with low level dopamine.",
        detailsEleven: "Eventually, all those small actions will add up to become big changes in your life. Every day you improve you are reinforcing the idea of success in your subconscious mind and over time subconscious mind changes its program and creates a new habits and victory becomes your habits. That’s why Aristotle told “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a Habit”. ",
        
        detailsTwelve: "Examples of Kaizen in daily life are: Goal – Read more books—Kaizen application – Read one page. Goal- Stop Talking Sugar- Kaizen application- one Spoon less Sugar in Tea. Goal- 100 Push Ups- Kaizen application- One additional Push Up every day. Goal – Write a book —Kaizen application – Write one paragraph a day. Goal – Lose weight—Kaizen application – Eat one bite less. Goal -Run a 5K—Kaizen application – Go for a 10-minute walk outside. Goal – Quit smoking—Kaizen application – Smoke 1/2 less cigarette. Goal – Meditate for 20 minutes every day—Kaizen application – Meditate for 1 minute. Goal – A cleaner workplace—Kaizen application – Set a timer and clean for just 5 minutes every day.Goal – Save Taka 500—Kaizen application – Save Taka 1 per day",
        detailsThirteen: "Now, are you ready to kaizen your life, here are some ideas on how to implement this philosophy in  your daily life 1.	Set a goal and ask yourself how can I reach it? Break down your goal and ask yourself questions like “What is the first thing I can do to make it?” Think about the smallest possible action that you could take towards achieving your goal.  2.	Prioritize your actions 3.	Focus on the process, not the goal 4.	Do it better, make it better: Always a better Way  5.	Mentally prepare: Give self affirmation, Visualize your success and fell it. 6.	Hansei (self-reflection): Make yourself accountable 7.	Take regular breaks throughout the day",

        Looking at the History of Japan’s Continuous growth and The Competitive Success, we see one of the core elements is Kaizen: The philosophy of Kaizen helps Japanese companies to outshine all other competitors by adhering to certain set policies and rules to eliminate defects and ensure long term superior quality, reducing lead time and cost, and eventually customer satisfaction. Work for a Japanese company and you would soon realize how much focus and importance they give to the process of Kaizen. Toyota, Japan's auto-industry leader, is well-known for implementing kaizen. In fact, kaizen is one of the core principles of Toyota, whose slogan is “Always a Better Way.”

        "Kaizen” refers to a Japanese word which means “improvement” or “change for the better”. Kaizen is core to Lean Manufacturing, is a philosophy to creating continuous improvement based on the idea that small, ongoing positive changes can bring radical change over time by continuous effort by each and every employee from the CEO to line staff to ensure improvement of all processes and systems of a particular organization. It was developed in the manufacturing sector to lower defects, enhancing quality, eliminate waste, boost productivity, encourage worker purpose and accountability, and promote innovation. The ultimate goal of Kaizen is the transformation of the culture of a company and Kaizen believes that the culture transforms when the mindset of the employee transforms which essentially means building positive habits for progress for a start of the journey from Good to Great! We often talk about Operational Excellence, but Operational Excellence without Personal Excellence is a big vacuum. Elimination of defects and ensuring long term superior quality, reducing lead time and cost, and customer satisfaction is not only required for an organization, it is eventually deeply needed by an individual for their growth which ultimately leads to the growth of the company. Until and unless the employees are growing, the company will not grow, the Kaizen Mind Set. HR has a major role to play here.

        With the new year well into motion, we focus on our New Year's resolutions or improving ourselves. Often, people make big promises to themselves at the beginning of the new year that are soon forgotten once the reality of everyday life sets in. Big goals can be overwhelming, wish for large, radical changes sound good but they can actually make you more resistant to change. There is a scientific and biological reason why this may happen, thanks to part of our brain called the “amygdala”.

    detailsEight: `
        The Amygdala is an almond-shaped set of neurons located in the brain. It is responsible for our fight-or-flight or stress response when we face with forthcoming danger. The Clinical Psychologist, Dr. Robert Mauer describe in the book, One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way: “When you want to change but experience a block, you can often blame the midbrain for gumming up the works. The midbrain is where you’ll find a structure called the amygdala. The amygdala is absolutely crucial to our survival. It controls the fight-or-flight response, an alarm mechanism that we share with all other mammals. It was designed to alert parts of the body for action in the face of immediate danger. One way it accomplishes this is to slow down or stop other functions such as rational and creative thinking that could interfere with the physical ability to run or fight.” He explains that the amygdala’s fight-or-flight response in today’s modern lifestyle, “…sets off alarm bells whenever we want to make a departure from our usual, safe routines.”

    detailsNine: `
        Dr. Mauer explains that Kaizen is effective in preventing the amygdala from spoiling our efforts as, “The little steps of kaizen are a kind of stealth solution to this quality of the brain.” He says in the book. “As your small steps continue and your cortex starts working, the brain begins to create ‘software’ for your desired change actually laying down new nerve pathways and building new habits.” You may wish for a big change in your life but the amygdala prevents you from bringing the change in you. It could bring on feelings of stress, panic, and anxiety and cause us to stop and leave the cause of the discomfort, i.e. the new change. How to overcome this problem?

        The solution lies in Kaizen. Kaizen turns the giant goal into baby steps aiming for little improvement each day gives you a feel of victory and triggers the release of a small dose of Dopamine in your neuro system. Our brains don’t distinguish between small and large victories. Reaching a goal of any size triggers a release of dopamine, the “feel good” neurotransmitter. Dopamine motivates you to take action towards your goal and gives you a surge of reinforcing pleasure when achieving them. Procrastination, self-doubt, and low or lack of enthusiasm are linked with low levels of dopamine.

        Eventually, all those small actions will add up to become big changes in your life. Every day you improve, you are reinforcing the idea of success in your subconscious mind and over time, the subconscious mind changes its program and creates new habits and victory becomes your habit. That’s why Aristotle said, “We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a Habit”.

        Now, are you ready to kaizen your life? Here are some ideas on how to implement this philosophy in your daily life:
        1. Set a goal and ask yourself how you can reach it. Break down your goal and ask yourself questions like “What is the first thing I can do to make it?” Think about the smallest possible action that you could take towards achieving your goal.
        2. Prioritize your actions.
        3. Focus on the process, not the goal.
        4. Do it better, make it better: Always a better Way.
        5. Mentally prepare: Give self affirmation, Visualize your success and feel it.
        6. Hansei (self-reflection): Make yourself accountable.
        7. Take regular breaks throughout the day.
